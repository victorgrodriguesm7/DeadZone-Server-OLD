## 📖 About

Recapturing The DeadZone is a community revival project for The Last Stand: Dead Zone. This private server allows players to relive the original game experience with a modern infrastructure developed in Kotlin.

> **⚠️ Note:** Note: This is an unofficial project. All rights to The Last Stand: Dead Zone are the exclusive property of Con Artist Games, who has granted us permission for this project.

> **⚠️ Security Notice:** This project uses outdated versions of Kotlin that may contain known security vulnerabilities and should not be used in production. The code itself is safe and can be run locally.

This version was originally released by Dead Zone Revive and is hosted here for preservation purposes. If you're interested in the project, feel free to contribute!

> 📚 See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for more details.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Java 25** or higher - [Download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads)
- **MariaDB 11+** - [Installation Guide](https://mariadb.org/download/)
- **Gradle** (included via wrapper)

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Configure the database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE prod_deadzone_game;
```

The tables will be automatically created when the server is started for the first time.

### 2. Server Configuration

Create the file `src/main/resources/application.yaml` from the template:

```bash
cp src/main/resources/application.yaml.example src/main/resources/application.yaml
```

Then modify with your settings:

```yaml
maria:
  url: jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/prod_deadzone_game
  user: root
  password: ""

game:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 7777
```

> **Note:** The `application.yaml` file contains sensitive information and should not be committed. It is ignored by `.gitignore`.

### 3. Compile the project

```bash
build.bat
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

### 4. Start the server

**Production mode (from the `deploy` folder):**
```bash
# Windows
autorun.bat

# Linux/macOS
./autorun.sh
```
